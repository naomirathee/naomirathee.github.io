<div class="aparnalit">
  Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin playing a vital role in human physiology. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent worldwide. This deficiency has many consequences which are still being explored, apart from the well-known skeletal complications. With this review, we aim to summarize the existing literature on Vitamin D status in India and understand the enormity of the problem. The prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency ranged from 40% to 99%, with most of the studies reporting a prevalence of 80%–90%. It was prevalent in all the age groups and high-risk groups alike. With the consequences of Vitamin D deficiency, namely, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and tuberculosis being explored, we can imagine the burden it would cause in our country. We need to create awareness among the public and healthcare providers about the importance of Vitamin D and the consequences of deficiency. Our Indian diet generally fails to satisfy the daily requirement of Vitamin D for a normal adult. This stresses on the need for fortifying various food with Vitamin D, through the national programs. This silent epidemic should be addressed appropriately with concrete public health action.

<div class="benerlit">
  The reported association between vitamin D level and loss of Bone mineral densitometry measurements (BMD) has been controversial. Objective: The objectı;ve of the current study was to determine whether low vitamin D level and BMD are associated with depresive symptoms as burden in Arab women during the menopausal and postmenopausal period. Design and Setting: A cross-sectional descriptive study design was used at the Primary Health Care (PHC) Centers in Qatar. Subjects: A multi-stage sampling design was used and a representative sample of 1436 women aged 45-65 years were included during July 2012 and November 2013 and 1106 women agreed to participate (77.2%) and responded to the study. Materials and Methods: BMD (g/m 2 ) was assessed at the BMD unit using a Lunar Prodigy DXA system (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI). The antero-posterior lumbar spine (L2-L4) and the mean of the proximal right and left femur were be measured by two technician and then reviewed by one radiologist. Data on body mass index (BMI), clinical biochemistry variables including serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were collected. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered for depression purposes. Results: Of the 1436 women living in urban and rural areas, 1106 women agreed to participate (77.0%) and responded to the study. The mean age and standard deviation of the subjects was 53.8 ± 3.2. The median age of natural menopausal in the present study was 49 years (mean and standard deviation 49.5 ± 3.1 and postmenopausal was 58.1 ± 3.3). There were statistically significant differences between menopausal stages with regards to ethnicity, education level, systolic and dialostic blood pressure, parity, sheesha smoking and depressive symptoms. Overall 30.4% of women were affected with osteopenia/osteoporosis in premenopausal and postmenopausal (24.4% vs 35.7%; P = 0.0442). Osteopenia in premenopausal and postmenopausal (18.7% vs 29.3%; P = 0.030) and Osteoporosis (9.9% vs 15.9%; P = 0.049) were significantly higher in post-menopausal women than in premenopausal women (P = 0.046). Similarly, vitamin D deficiency was more prevalent among postmenopausal women than menopausal women. Overall, only 15.1% of women had optimum vitamin D level and 15.5% had severe, 33.2% had moderate vitamin D insufficiency and 36.3% had mild vitamin D insufficiency in menopausal and post menopausal women (P =¬ 0.021). The study revealed that vitamin D level, hemoglobin level, serum iron fasting plasma glucose, calcium, triglycerides, high density lipid (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipid (LDL) Cholesterol, alkaline phosphate and magnesium were considerably lower in postmenopausal compared to menopausal women (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The current study revealed that there was a strong association between vitamin D level and BMD in Arab women during the menopausal and post-menopausal period.

</div>

<div class="dinglit">
Dermal wound healing, in which transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) plays an important role, is a complex process. Previous studies suggest that vitamin D has a potential regulatory role in TGFβ1 induced activation in bone formation, and there is cross-talk between their signaling pathways, but research on their effects in other types of wound healing is limited. The authors therefore wanted to explore the role of vitamin D and its interaction with low concentration of TGFβ1 in dermal fibroblast-mediated wound healing through an in vitro study.
Human dermal fibroblasts were treated with vitamin D, TGFβ1, both, or vehicle, and then the wound healing functions of dermal fibroblasts were measured. To further explore possible mechanisms explaining the synergistic effect of vitamin D and TGFβ1, targeted gene silencing of the vitamin D receptor was performed.Compared to either factor alone, treatment of fibroblasts with both vitamin D and low concentration of TGFβ1 increased gene expression of TGFβ1, connective tissue growth factor, and fibronectin 1, and enhanced fibroblast migration, myofibroblast formation, and collagen production. Vitamin D receptor gene silencing blocked this synergistic effect of vitamin D and TGFβ1 on both collagen production and myofibroblast differentiation. Thus a synergistic effect of vitamin D and low TGFβ1 concentration was found in dermal fibroblast-mediated wound healing in vitro.This study suggests that supplementation of vitamin D may be an important step to improve wound healing and regeneration in patients with a vitamin D deficiency.

</div>

<div class="fullardlit">
  Vitamin D is a fat-soluble secosteroid that exerts its effects by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), through which it directly and indirectly modulates the expression of hundreds to thousands of genes. While originally known for its role in regulating calcium homeostasis and metabolism, vitamin D is now associated with many other health conditions, including Parkinson's disease (PD). A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been noted in PD for at least the past two decades. These findings, along with the discovery that the VDR and 1[ALPHA]-hydroxylase, the enzyme that converts vitamin D to its active form, are highly expressed in the substantia nigra, led to the hypothesis that inadequate levels of circulating vitamin D may lead to dysfunction or cell death within the substantia nigra. Studies investigating the relationship between vitamin D status and PD, however, have been inconsistent. Two prospective studies examined the association between mid-life vitamin D levels and risk of PD and produced conflicting results-one demonstrated an increased risk for PD with lower mid-life vitamin D levels, and the other showed no association between vitamin D and PD risk. One of the most consistent findings in the literature is the inverse association between serum vitamin D level and motor symptom severity in cross-sectional studies. While these data suggest that vitamin D may modify the disease, another likely explanation is confounding due to limited mobility. Fall risk has been associated with vitamin D in PD, but more study is needed to determine if supplementation decreases falls, which has been demonstrated in the general population. The association between vitamin D and non-motor symptoms is less clear. There is some evidence that vitamin D is associated with verbal fluency and verbal memory in PD. Studies in PD have also shown associations between vitamin D status and mood, orthostatic hypotension and olfactory impairment in PD. While more research is needed, given the numerous potential benefits and limited risks, vitamin D level assessment in PD patients and supplementation for those with deficiency and insufficiency seems justified.

<div class="garlandlit">
  We examined the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and all-cause mortality. We searched biomedical databases for articles that assessed 2 or more categories of 25(OH)D from January 1, 1966, to January 15, 2013. We identified 32 studies and pooled the data. The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality comparing the lowest (0-9 nanograms per milliliter [ng/mL]) to the highest (> 30 ng/mL) category of 25(OH)D was 1.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.6, 2.2; P < .001). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than or equal to 30 ng/mL were associated with higher all-cause mortality than concentrations greater than 30 ng/mL (P < .01). Our findings agree with a National Academy of Sciences report, except the cutoff point for all-cause mortality reduction in this analysis was greater than 30 ng/mL rather than greater than 20 ng/mL.

<div class="gezmishlit">
  In recent years there has been a resurgence in vitamin D deficiency worldwide in subjects of all ages, ranging from infants through to the elderly. The rise in vitamin D deficiency has been attributed to a variety of causes including reduced exposure to sunlight, reduced production of cholecalciferol in the skin and/or reduced vitamin D absorption. Of concern, vitamin D deficiency is strongly linked to an increased incidence of heart disease. In this regard, the studies in this thesis explore the effects of maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy and lactation on the development of the heart and the effects of subsequent lifelong vitamin D deficiency on cardiac structure and function.

  Studies related to vitamin D deficiency and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children have inconsistent findings. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in children with LRTI, and to evaluate the correlation between vitamin D levels and the incidence and severity of LRTI. A total of 12 studies enrolling 2279 participants were included in our analysis. Children with LRTI were found to have significantly lower mean vitamin D levels as compared to controls There was likewise a correlation between vitamin D levels and incidence and severity of LRTI. Large randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate effect of vitamin D supplementation for LRTI.

<div class="masoudilit">
  Introduction: Given that nurses are among professions with frequent problems of fatigue, and given the nature of their profession that provides little exposure to sunlight and the subsequent deficiency of vitamin D, the present study examined the relation between fatigue and circulating vitamin D levels in female nurses working in Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Kashan, Iran in 2013. Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 200 female nurses working in Shahid Beheshti Hospital. To measure fatigue, fatigue questionnaire containing 9 questions eliciting the subject’s feeling in scales of 1 to 7, getting a possible score of 9 to 63, and Visual Analogue Scale in which nurses specified their fatigue in a band of zero to 10 were used. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which is the most important vitamin D metabolite, also was determined. The data was analyzed by SPSS-16. The Pearson’s correlation of coefficients, t-test, and multiple regression analysis were used in this study. Results: The mean fatigue score of nurses was 38.76±12.66 in questionnaire and 5.73±2.12 in Visual Analog Scale. The 89 per cent of nurses suffered from vitamin D deficiency, 9.5 percent of them had normal level and 1.5 per cent had toxicity level of vitamin D. There was a significant relationship between vitamin D level and fatigue scores (P<0.0001), and visual fatigue scores (P<0.0001). According to multivariate regression analysis, vitamin D level accounted for 13 per cent of the fatigue based on data on questionnaire and 18.6 per cent of fatigue according to Visual Analog Scale. Conclusion: High prevalence of fatigue among nurses could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency.

<div class="mcdonnelllit">
  While numerous epidemiologic studies have found an association between higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and lower breast cancer risk, few have assessed this association for concentrations >40 ng/ml. Objective To investigate the relationship between 25(OH)D concentration and breast cancer risk across a broad range of 25(OH)D concentrations among women aged 55 years and older. Methods Analyses used pooled data from two randomized clinical trials (N = 1129, N = 2196) and a prospective cohort (N = 1713) to examine a broad range of 25(OH)D concentrations. The outcome was diagnosis of breast cancer during the observation periods (median: 4.0 years). Three analyses were conducted: 1) Incidence rates were compared according to 25(OH)D concentration from 20 to [greater than or equal to]60 ng/ml (50 to [greater than or equal to]150 nmol/L), 2) Kaplan-Meier plots were developed and 3) multivariate Cox regression was used to examine the association between 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk using multiple 25(OH)D measurements. Results Within the pooled cohort (N = 5038), 77 women were diagnosed with breast cancer (age-adjusted incidence: 512 cases per 100,000 person-years). Results were similar for the three analyses. First, comparing incidence rates, there was an 82% lower incidence rate of breast cancer for women with 25(OH)D concentrations [greater than or equal to]60 vs 20 ng/ml (Rate Ratio = 0.18, P = 0.006). Second, Kaplan-Meier curves for concentrations of 20, 20-39, 40-59 and [greater than or equal to]60 ng/ml were significantly different (P = 0.02), with the highest proportion breast cancer-free in the [greater than or equal to]60 ng/ml group (99.3%) and the lowest proportion breast cancer-free in the 20 ng/ml group (96.8%). The proportion with breast cancer was 78% lower for [greater than or equal to]60 vs 20 ng/ml (P = 0.02). Third, multivariate Cox regression revealed that women with 25(OH)D concentrations [greater than or equal to]60 ng/ml had an 80% lower risk of breast cancer than women with concentrations 20 ng/ml (HR = 0.20, P = 0.03), adjusting for age, BMI, smoking status, calcium supplement intake, and study of origin. Conclusions Higher 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with a dose-response decrease in breast cancer risk with concentrations [greater than or equal to]60 ng/ml being most protective.

  Recently, scientists have generated a strong body of evidence providing new information about the preventive effect of vitamin D on a broad range of disorders. This evidence suggests that vitamin D is much more than a nutrient needed for bone health; it is an essential hormone required for regulation of a large number of physiological functions. Sufficient concentration of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is essential for optimising human health. This article reviews the present state-of-the-art knowledge about vitamin D’s status worldwide and refers to recent articles discussing some of the general background of vitamin D, including sources, benefits, deficiencies, and dietary requirements, especially in pregnancy. They offer evidence that vitamin D deficiency could be a major public health burden in many parts of the world, mostly because of sun deprivation. The article also discusses the debate about optimal concentration of circulating serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and explores different views on the amount of vitamin D supplementation required to achieve and maintain this concentration.

<div class="mohrlit">
  Finland has the highest incidence rate of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in the world,1 and its rates are rapidly rising.2,3 Finland is located at 60 –70 degrees latitude, making oral vitamin D intake important. At temperate latitudes, 90% of circulating vitamin D is produced by exposure of the skin to ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance, which is virtually nonexistent during the long winters in Finland. Several substantial reductions in offıcial recommendations for vitamin D intake by children were each followed by a rise in incidence rates.4 Although other explanations are possible, vitamin D inadequacy might partly account for the steep rise.2,3 In a birth cohort study, children in Finland who consumed 2000 IU per day of vitamin D had 78% lower incidence of T1DM than those who consumed less.4 Two other observational studies found that taking vitamin D or cod liver oil was associated with substantially reduced risk of T1DM.5,6 The current study examined the possible association of reductions in offıcial Finnish vitamin D intake recommendations with incidence of T1DM. Although increasing incidence has been reported separately for 1965– 19853 and 1980 –2005,2 this is the fırst analysis covering the entire 1965–2005 interval, and the fırst to use regression.

  Mounting evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency could be linked to several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its correlates to test the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency was common in the US population, especially in certain minority groups. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005 to 2006 data were analyzed for vitamin D levels in adult participants (N = 4495). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations ≤20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L). The overall prevalence rate of vitamin D deficiency was 41.6%, with the highest rate seen in blacks (82.1%), followed by Hispanics (69.2%). Vitamin D deficiency was significantly more common among those who had no college education, were obese, with a poor health status, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, or not consuming milk daily (all P < .001). Multivariate analyses showed that being from a non-white race, not college educated, obese, having low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, poor health, and no daily milk consumption were all significantly, independently associated with vitamin D deficiency (all P < .05). In summary, vitamin D deficiency was common in the US population, especially among blacks and Hispanics. Given that vitamin D deficiency is linked to some of the important risk factors of leading causes of death in the United States, it is important that health professionals are aware of this connection and offer dietary and other intervention strategies to correct vitamin D deficiency, especially in minority groups.

<div class="pletzlit">
  Objectives We aimed to explore the association between vitamin D levels and the severity, mortality and microbiological etiology of community-acquired pneumonia. Methods Vitamin D levels (both, the reservoir form 25-OH and the activated form 1,25-OH2) of 300 randomly selected patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to pre-specified pathogens included in the German competence network (CAPNETZ) study were measured. Prior to statistical analysis, values of 25-OH and 1,25-OH2 were power-transformed to achieve parametric distribution. All further analyses were performed with seasonally and age adjusted values. Results There was only a modest (Spearman Coefficient 0.38) positive correlation between 25-OH and 1,25-OH2. For 1,25-OH2 but not 25-OH, the general linear model revealed a significant inverse correlation between serum concentration and CURB score (p = 0.011). Liver and respiratory co-morbidity were associated with significantly lower 25-OH values and renal co-morbidity with significantly lower 1,25-OH2 values. No significant differences of 1,25-OH2 or 25-OH between different pathogens (influenza virus, Legionella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae) were detected. Conclusion For 1,25-OH2, we found a significant and independent (controlled for age, season and pathogen) negative correlation to pneumonia severity. Therefore, supplementation of non-activated vitamin D to protect from pneumonia may be non-sufficient in patients that have a decreased capacity to hydroxylate 25-OH to 1,25-OH2.
