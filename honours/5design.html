  ABSTRACT
  <br>
  During the COVID-19 pandemic which has caused an unprecedented health and
  economic crisis around the globe, several countries, like China and the UK, developed makeshift
  hospitals by converting public venues of other intended use (e.g, stadiums, convention centres,
  exhibition centres, gymnasiums, factories, and warehouses) to medical facilities, aiming to
  achieve in very little time a substantial upgrade of the health system’s capacity. This change
  management capability is among the fundamental elements of infrastructure futureproofing, i.e.
  the process of making provision for future developments, needs or events that impact on
  particular infrastructure through its current planning, design, construction or asset management
  processes. This paper utilizes the limited available experience from these makeshift hospitals to
  shed light on the critical design parameters efficiently enabling the infrastructure to adapt to
  required changes in structure and / or operations. However, future-proofing should not be a
  standalone component but should be efficiently embedded in asset management practice. For this
  purpose, this paper also proposes an appropriate associated delivery paradigm encompassing
  Value Management and Building Information modelling (BIM), to allow for the asset owners
  and designers to efficiently incorporate flexibility in their design planning. The structured
  approach of Value Management can be used to ensure that the project’s characteristics are
  aligned to the public client’s requirements for futureproofing while a BIM-based design
  management paradigm is particularly appropriate, as it allows for design changes to be shared,
  visualized, estimated, and resolved without the use of time-consuming paper transactions.

  INTRODUCTION
  <br>
  On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted to a cluster of pneumonia patients in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. One week later, on 7 January 2020, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a novel (new) coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, as the cause of the pneumonia and few days later, on 11 January 2020, the first fatality was reported. On 30 January 2020, the DirectorGeneral of WHO declared the 2019‑nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern under the International Health Regulations, following advice from the Emergency Committee (WHO, 2020a). As of 26 July 2020, 15,785,641 cases of infections and 640,016 deaths had been
  reported worldwide as a result of COVID19, the acute respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, with more than half of the deaths being recorded in Europe. The
  hardest hit European countries were the UK,
  Italy, France and Spain (WHO, 2020b). 
  <br>
  <br>
  The statistics published by the UN’s
  Committee for the Coordination of
  Statistical Activities (CCSA, 2020) reveal
  that COVID- 19 and the almost global
  lockdown it caused, has brought dramatic
  changes in all aspects of public and private
  lifeand unprecedented disruptions to
  economies and labour markets. The data
  points and inflections in trends would have
  been unimaginable only a few months ago:
  9% year-on-year fall in global production
  and manufacturing output, predicted fall of
  the value of global merchandise trade by
  almost 27% in Q2 2020 and the largest fall
  in global commodity prices on record (-
  20.4% between February and March 2020).
  On the social side, there is a shocking loss of
  employment – a decline of almost 10.5% in
  total working hours or 305 million full-time
  workers, some 1.6 billion students have been
  affected by school closures and the crisis
  will push an additional 40 – 60 million
  people into extreme poverty (CCSA, 2020).
  <br>
  <br>
  In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,
  the world also witnessed China building a
  new 645,000-square-foot emergency
  medical facility with a capacity of 1,000
  patients in just 10 days (BBCa, 2020) as
  well as the conversion of public venues such
  as stadiums and exhibition centers into
  temporary healthcare facilities in several
  countries, including China, US and the UK.
  16 such facilities, also called Fangcang
  shelter hospitals, were opened in Wuhan city
  in February 2020 for the isolation and care
  of patients with mild to moderate COVID19 symptoms. These emergency facilities
  were created over a period of 3 weeks in less
  than 2 days each, contained 13,000 hospitals
  beds and played a major role to the
  successful control of the COVID-19
  pandemic in China (Chen et al., 2020). 
  <br>
  <br>
  Similarly, in the US the army corps of
  engineers (USACE) built 17 alternate care
  sites in 8 states (USACE, 2020) while in the
  UK, the NHS created 8 makeshift hospitals
  in England, 1 in Scotland and 1 in Wales,
  utilizing available infrastructure including
  Conference and Exhibition Centers, Sport
  and Leisure Centers, School buildings and
  Stadiums (BBC, 2020b; Wikipedia
  2020).The largest of these makeshift
  hospitals is the London NHS 'Nightingale'
  facility, made up of two wards each with
  space for 2,000 people, created within the
  ExCel conference center of east London, in
  just nine days. 
  <br>
  <br>
  It goes without saying that the
  abovementioned makeshift hospitals make
  one of the most powerful examples of a
  futureproof infrastructure, i.e. an
  infrastructure with the ability to adapt to
  required changes in structure and / or
  operations in the future e.g. expansion of
  capacity, change in usage mode or volumes
  (Masood et al., 2014).The experience of the
  ongoing COVID-19 pandemic particularly
  highlights the crucial role of adaptive design
  strategies which allow for public venues
  such as the aforementioned ones to be
  rapidly converted into hospitals and achieve
  in very little time a substantial upgrade of
  the health system’s capacity.This paper aims
  to shed light on the critical design
  parameters of makeshift hospitalsand outline
  the required design delivery paradigm for
  effectively futureproofing design development in the context of emergency healthcare needs. 
  <br>
  <br>
  BACKGROUND
  <br>
  The delivery of healthcare services remains
  largely site based, requiring significant
  physical space for medical personnel to
  conduct all of the activities associated with
  the provision of medical care and attention.
  However, large hospital construction
  projects are planned from 10 to 20 years in
  advance, and hospitals are typically
  designed to have a lifespan of more than 40
  years. Furthermore, all hospitals must
  respond over their life cycles to changing
  demands imposed by shifting demographics,
  increasingly sophisticated medical
  technologies, workforce capacity and
  capability issues, pressured public and
  private sector health budgets and changing
  epidemiological patterns (Carthey et al.,
  2011; Olsson and Hansen 2010). 
  <br>
  <br>
  In the above context, the concept of design
  flexibility as a means of responding to the
  uncertainty is no stranger at all to the
  healthcare sector. Flexibility changes the
  goal from optimizing designs to a set of
  deterministic point forecasts to finding
  designs that will affect favorably the entire
  distribution of possible outcomes (Cardin,
  2014). Besides, an optimal design is one that
  inhibits change of function least, rather than
  one that fits a specific function best (Healy
  and McKee 2002). According to Olsson and
  Hansen (2010), the three aspects of
  flexibility are adaptability, convertibility and
  expandability. Adaptability can be defined
  as the ability of a building to meet shifting
  demands without physical changes.
  Convertibility can be defined as the possibility for construction and technical changes with minimum cost and disturbance. Finally, expandability can be defined as the ability to increase (or reduce) the size of a building. Examples of flexible design in hospital buildings can include structural foundations that allow additional floors to be added on top of existing buildings, or areas that are built but not fitted out with medical equipment, or functional roomsthat may be refitted for medical purposes other than their original use (De Neufville and Scholtes, 2011). 
  <br>
  <br>
  However, all the literature around design
  flexibility concerns non-temporary facilities,
  designed and intended from the beginning to
  be used as medical care premises.Τhe case
  of makeshift hospitals is totally different, in
  the sense that the selected venues (exhibition
  centers, stadiums, leisure centers etc) had
  never been designed to be used for medical
  care purposes. Therefore, their primary
  feature is this of adaptability i.e. the ability
  to be readily adapted or reconfigured in
  response to changing needs, uses, capacities,
  risks or requirements (Masood et al.,
  2014).This change management capability is
  among the fundamental elements of
  infrastructure futureproofing, which can be
  defined as “the process of making provision
  for future developments, needs or events
  that impact on particular infrastructure
  through its current planning, design,
  construction or asset management
  processes” (Masood et al. 2014). 
  <br>
  <br>
  DESIGN AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE FROM THE COVID-19 MAKESHIFT HOSPITALS
  <br>
  In the context of futureproofing and the associated design flexibility management, it is beneficial to identify the critical parts of projects where flexibility is needed and choose appropriate strategies for its
  implementation (Olsson 2006).The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,unavoidably shifts the focus of futureproofing towards large public venues (e.g, stadiums, convention centres, exhibition centres, gymnasiums, factories, and warehouses) which have the potential to be used as makeshift hospitals in case of emergency. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Although there currently are very limited
  sources available, some preliminary points
  of guidance can be drawn. Specifically,
  Chen et al. (2020) stress that future design
  and construction of large public venues with
  such a potential, should integrate features
  facilitating the required conversion like
  interior equipment that can be rapidly
  removed, entrances that are large enough for
  hospital beds and ventilation systems that
  reduce the risk of cross-infection.
  Furthermore, the London Nightingale
  hospital’s contractor, BDP, highlighted that
  the Exhibition Center was selected because
  of its large flat floor hall spaces with flexible
  mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP)
  infrastructure that could easily be adapted to
  meet the needs of the temporary hospital.
  Also, minimal building intervention was
  essential to ensure rapid project delivery, so
  the building assets were used to the
  maximum; the bed heads and service
  corridors were constructed utilizing a
  component system usually used to construct
  exhibition stands while simple
  reinforcement allowed for services to be
  fitted to the walls (BDP, 2020a; Architect’s
  Journal, 2020).
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, BDP (2020b) drew up an
  instruction manual to share with other
  countries taking on similar emergency
  projects, which provides very useful
  insightson the fit-out strategies and
  processes adopted. The notes and sketches
  reveal that space is the most crucial factor
  with requirements encompassing clear span,
  large flexible space for the patients wards
  and additionally, space for medical gases,
  space for General parking, space for
  Ambulance parking, space for Temporary
  generators, space for staff changing and
  showers and space to accommodate CTs (at
  least two for resilience) and temporary
  mortuaries. Other space related
  considerations include air ambulance access,
  the proximity of the venue to appropriate
  staff accommodation and the ability of the
  existing venue’s fire strategy to align with
  the new function, considering different risks
  in the form of increased oxygen and
  evacuation of patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the recent experience confirms
  how efficient ventilation is of paramount
  importance along with determining clean
  and dirty routes and specifying the
  permissible flows of equipment, medical
  staff and patients through the ward’s clean
  and dirty areas. BDP’s instructions (2020)
  for the ventilation suggest the use of existing
  systems and modification of controls to
  maximize fan duty, ensure full fresh air with
  no recirculation and introduce a pressure
  regime to push air from clean areas to dirty
  areas and out of the building. Chen and
  Zhao (2020) confirm the primary role of
  ventilation in infection control highlighting
  the fact that the insufficient ventilation in
  makeshift hospitals may increase infection
  risk of opportunistic airborne transmission.
  They urge for the ventilation rates to
  increase to as high as the system can support
  and additionally suggest the use of air
  purifiers to reduce the possible virus-laden
  aerosols. The critical contribution of
  ventilation systems has also been noted by
  Chen et al. (2020) and Her (2020) drawing
  on China’s and South Korea’s experience
  from emergency medical facilities. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Furthermore, mechanical ventilation systems
  are also crucial for the creation of negative
  pressure rooms, i.e. rooms where the pressure of the air is at a slightly lower level than the pressure of the entry area, so that contaminated air cannot escape from the isolation room, as air naturally flows from areas with higher pressure to areas with lower pressure (Agarwal et al., 2020).
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from ventilation, the fundamental role
  of the venue’s mechanical systems is also
  evidenced by the crucial need for reliable
  electrical infrastructure to support the
  function of ICU’s life-saving ventilators and
  equipmentas well as the absolute
  requirement for an efficient network able to
  supply medical gases (e.g. oxygen) to each
  of the beds. London Nightingale project’s
  experience shows that extensive upgrading
  modifications were necessary to ensure the
  power supply can cope with demand while a
  bespoke gas installation was constructed
  with two distribution ring mains running
  around the basement car park at high level,
  rising up to feed each bed head through the
  services floor boxes (Architect’s Journal,
  2020; BBC, 2020b). The medical gases
  system was located at a space adjacent to the
  ward block to facilitate the installation of the
  gas circuits required to connect the oxygen
  evaporators and the air compressors with the
  ward (BDP, 2020b)
  <br>
  <br>
  The infrastructure system also needs to be
  able to support the operation of video and
  audio devices. Video surveillance is crucial
  in safeguarding equipment, medicines,
  personal protective equipment (PPE) and
  other supplies while also being necessary for
  access control and to restrict public access
  for contagion mitigation. Furthermore, video
  and audio surveillance solutions can be used
  for the communication between patients and
  healthcare professionals, minimizing
  unnecessary patient contact, and aiding them
  in prioritizing resources where they are
  needed most (Axis communications, 2020).
  The utilization of popular and easy to use
  information and technology solutions like
  smart phone apps and cloud during the
  COVID-19 pandemic for efficient patient
  monitoring by doctors and nurses has been
  indicatively reported by Xu et al. (2020),
  Bae et al. (2020) and Hillrom (2020). 
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from the staff’s and patients’
  wellbeing and safety discussed above,
  another essential aspect highlighted by the
  recent experience from makeshift hospitals,
  is that of biosecurity. Given the dependence
  of virus stability on temperature, hot water
  of at least 70°C should be made available
  for cleaning purposes (Agarwal et al., 2020).
  For the decontamination and sterilization of
  equipment, steam can be used as a simple,
  cost-effective sterilization technique (de
  Man, 2020). However a central steam supply
  for this purpose seems not to be essential as
  the majority of published protocols rely on
  specialized commercial steam bags which in
  case of limited supply can be efficiently
  replaced by microwave-generated steam
  (Zulauf et al., 2020). 
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the environmental safety, the use
  of relevant disposal protocols is mandatory.
  As far as wastewater treatment is concerned,
  Wang et al. (2020) explain that the kind of
  disinfectant used largely determines the
  engineering characteristics of the hospital
  system, e.g. the pipes location, length,
  height and material. Zhang et al. (2020)
  describe the disinfection system applied to
  the first makeshift hospital in Wuhan.
  Regarding the centralized disposal of
  COVID-19 medical waste, this is
  preferentially treated by high temperature
  incineration which is the most common and
  effective way to kill infectious pathogens
  (Peng et al., 2020). Detailed protocols for
  the packaging and pretreatment of waste is
  provided by Wang et al (2020), Duan et al.
  (2020) and Peng et al. (2020). 
  <br>
  <br>
  DESIGN DELIVERY PARADIGM FOR EFFICIENT FUTUREPROOFING
  <br>
  Masood et al. (2016) note that futureproofing should not be a standalone component but should be efficiently
  embedded in asset management practice. This requires addressing stakeholder requirements at an early stage, adopting standardized approaches, establishing and
  implementing criteria to help assess the current state of future-proofing and take necessary actions to keep on future-proofing agenda (Masood et al. 2016). 
  <br>
  <br>
  The above requirements point directly
  towards the structured approach of Value
  Management which can be used to ensure
  that the project’s characteristics are aligned
  to the public client’s requirements for
  futureproofing or any other aspect of
  interest. The process incorporates a series of
  workshops involving key representatives
  from both the public client and the designer
  where the stakeholders are expected to reach
  consensus onwhat constitutes ‘value’ for
  them, how this translates into specific
  criteria and how they rank in terms of
  relative importance (Connaughton and
  Green, 1996).
  <br>
  <br>
  By incorporating the above-mentioned
  design aspects in the criteria used for the
  evaluation of design alternatives, the public
  client is bound to comparatively score them
  against these criteria and ultimately identify
  the one presenting the best future-proofing
  performance. Detailed examples of the
  process can be found in ICE (1996). A point
  of caution in the above process concerns the
  workshops’ attendees who should
  collectively have the necessary experience
  to make informed decisions. Especially in
  the context of healthcare facilities’ design,
  the multi-disciplinary needs require many
  different disciplines to be brought together
  under a unified umbrella with the aim to
  make a streamlined plan for establishing the
  unit (Agarwal et al., 2020). The Nightingale
  hospital’s contractor has specifically
  highlighted that the experience of the
  healthcare architecture team and their
  understanding of clinical flows allowed
  logical repurposing spaces with minimal
  new construction (Architect’s Journal,
  2020).
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, given the uncertainty involved
  and in line with the view that the constantly
  changing futureproofing requirements
  require a radical shift of construction
  towards the ‘digital era’ (Love et al., 2018),
  the most appropriate design management
  paradigm is one based on a Building
  Information model (BIM). BIM is a digital
  representation of all physical and functional
  characteristics of a facility or site, serving as
  a knowledge database which enables reliable
  information exchange and decisions during
  the asset’s life cycle from inception onwards
  (Krystallis et al., 2015). In case of an urgent
  need for conversion of the facility the use of
  BIM is particularly appropriate, as it allows
  for design changes to be shared, visualized,
  estimated, and resolved without the use of
  time-consuming paper transactions (Sacks et
  al., 2018). 
  <br>
  <br>
  Furthermore, it provides opportunities for
  facility managers to effectively manage
  health and safety issues forfacility users by
  inputting into BIM data from on-site sensors
  monitoring the infrastructure condition
  (Fanning et al., 2014). The latter is of
  critical importance in the context of a
  potential need for transformation and
  upgrade of ventilation and other mechanical
  and electrical systems as seen in the recently
  converted makeshift hospitals in the UK. A
  relevant ontology of building monitoring
  data and building performance indicators
  has recently been proposed by Mahdavi and
  Wolosiuk (2019). 
  <br>
  <br>
  The aforementioned design delivery
  paradigm encompassing Value Management
  and BIM will allow for the asset owners and
  designers to efficiently incorporate
  flexibility in their design planning, in
  contrast to the usual practice of flexibility
  being frequently used but rarely prepared for
  (Olsson 2006).
  <br>
  <br>
  CONCLUSION
  <br>
  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an
  unprecedented health and economic crisis
  with unpredictably deep and multifaceted
  consequences, already felt around the globe.
  Securing the operation of health facilities
  able to cope with the outbreak of such a
  highly contagious as well as lethal disease,
  has been the top priority for many
  governments. In fears that the capacity of
  traditional hospitals would be overwhelmed,
  makeshift hospitals were developed in
  several countries, by converting public
  venues of other intended use to medical
  facilities.  
  <br>
  <br>
  The so far very limited literature around
  these emergency hospitals’ design features,
  reveals several critical aspects including the
  existence of large flat space for the patient
  ward, availability of large space for
  fundamental and auxiliary medical and nonmedical operations, a ventilation system able
  to adapt as per the required standards for
  infection control, an equally adaptable MEP
  infrastructure, air ambulance access,
  proximity of the venue to appropriate staff
  accommodation and fire safety features able
  to align with the new function. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Awareness of these features enables the
  decision makers to proactively identify
  suitable venues for use as makeshift
  hospitals so as to better plan their response
  in case of a second spike of the COVID-19
  pandemic or a similar public health
  emergency. Furthermore, the aforementioned features can be used as a
  futureproofing checklist for owners and
  designers planning new public venues, as
  they are best placed to timely ensure that the
  new facilities can potentially be utilized as
  emergency medical facilities if needed,
  either immediately or following limited
  upgrade. Finally, the use of Value
  Management approach and BIM, form the
  most appropriate design delivery
  paradigm,able to significantly increase the
  futureproofing value and performance of
  new facilities in the context of emergency
  accommodation of urgent healthcare needs.
