    Interviewing my Grandma

    <br><br>
    Interviews are a fundamental research method for direct contact with participants, to collect firsthand personal accounts of experience, opinions attitudes and perceptions.
  </div>
  <div class="copy">
    <br><br>
    Method: Interviewing my grandma. Prompting some discussion but mainly allowing the conversation to flow.
    <br><br>
    Aims: 
    <br>
    - What does she do in her day-to-day? 
    <br>
    - How much is she interacting with the Victorian community?
    <br>
    - Where does she get her public health information?
    <br>
    - To determine where public health design is best positioned to target her
    <br>
    - Where would she get her public health information if her family weren’t able to provide that for her?
    <br>
    - What does she think of existing public health design (shown examples)
    <br><br>

    Key findings:
    <br>
    - My grandma gets up, has a cup of tea, looks in the fridge to see what she can cook for the day, watch some TV, naps, cooks, eats, does some gardening, watches TV again and goes to bed.
    <br>
    - The only time she interacts with the Victorian community is when she goes with her son (my uncle) to the supermarket or other stores when purchasing groceries or other goods as required. She will go out 2-3 times a week.
    <br>
    - She gets most of her public health information from live press conferences on TV that my uncle translates for her. She cannot understand this information on her own. She also watches SBS and Indian TV and hears about COVID-19 on those programs.
    <br>
    - The only time she leaves the house will be to go to the supermarket, otherwise the only other way she would be able to get information on her own is from the TV or phone call.
    <br>
    - She said she would likely hear about it from her Indian friends whose husbands all work in hospitality and were impacted by the lockdowns.
    <br>
    - She responded well to the Hitachi light sensors and said she understood what was being asked without any use of words. She would not have been able to understand the Staying Apart campaign and would likely have not noticed it. 
    <br>
    - She is highly aware of the dangers of COVID-19 and still wears a mask even though it is no longer mandatory. She is very concerned for not only hers but for others health.
    <br>
    - She does not understand much about the virus but she knows it is spread by people who are too close to each other and by coughing and sneezing around others.
    <br>
    - Written information is not necessary for her to understand it
    <br><br>
    Next steps: 
    <br>
    - Start sketching some designs that are simple and don’t require words
    <br>
    - Consider the environment, where will it target her?
    <br><br>
    Self reflection: 
    <br>
    - I would try some speculative designs to show her and see how she responds to various concepts
