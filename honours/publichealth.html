    What is public health?
  </div>
  <div class="copy">
    <br><br>
   Public health refers to the use of science and health information and how it can be applied to communities and individuals for disease prevention and improved quality of life outcomes. In public health, there must be an equilibrium of data and its practical execution. This is because scientific data can provide theoretical solutions but it is the practical application that must be successful to achieve improved health. Application is likely to be multi-faceted and therefore complicated to achieve the theoretical outcome.
   <br><br>
   Public health has vast scope so it can look very different within the field. Here are some examples of what public health can look like:
   <br><br>
   - Education
   <br>
  - Health policy (eg. water fluoridation to reduce tooth decay, food safety)
  <br>
  - Health promotion programs (eg. healthy eating programs)
  <br>
  - Health specialists (eg. dietician, occupational therapist)
  <br>
  - Hospitals and other medical facilities
  <br>
  - Infrastructure
  <br>
  - Medically supervised injecting centres
  <br>
  - Not-for-profit organisations (eg. Médecins sans frontières)
  <br>
  - Public health campaigns (eg. anti smoking advertisements)
  <br>
  - Research
  <br>
  - Suicide prevention
  <br>
  - Universal health coverage
  <br>
  - Vaccines
  <br>
  - Water sanitation

    What does decolonising mean?
  </div>
  <div class="copy">
    <br><br>
    In this context, colonising means using a "one size fits all" mentality or using a "Western" approach for design solutions. To decolonise would be to address those that may get missed by the colonist approach.
