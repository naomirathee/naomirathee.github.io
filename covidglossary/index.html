  Airborne refers to transmission that can occur from infected air. This can happen when tiny infectious droplets that have been released by an infected person hangs in the air for a long period of time.
  An example of this is when an infected person coughs and doesn’t cover their mouth properly, droplets containing COVID-19 can hang in the air and expose someone nearby, to the virus. The virus can linger after the initial infected person is gone, which is why it is important to wear a mask.

  An antibody, or immunoglobulin, is a Y-shaped blood protein that the body’s immune system produces to defeat a specific antigen. Antibodies are made to keep our bodies healthy from illness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antigens are a toxin or something that the body identifies as alien. Antigens include bacteria, viruses and other foreign substances in the blood.

  Being asymptomatic is when a person who is infected with COVID-19 does not show or develop symptoms.

  An asymptomatic person can still infect other people. So even if a person doesn’t seem like they’re infected, it does not mean they are not.

  The case fatality rate (CFR) is the amount of deaths compared to the total number of people diagnosed. This calculation is often presented as a percentage.
  <br>
  <br>
  This number is often used as a way of measuring how severe a disease may be, but it should not be the only indication of the severity of a disease.

  <div class="reading">
  A clinical trial is an experiment or observation done as part of clinical research. This research studies new tests and treatments and evaluates their effects on human health. This research is conducted on volunteers to test medical research. These trials are very carefully done and have to be approved before they can even start. In biomedical clinical trials, there are 4 phases: Phase 1 usually tests a new drug for the first time in a small group to decide a safe amount and to see if there are any side effects. Phase 2 tests for the same thing as Phase 1 but in a larger group of people. Phase 3 is tested on larger groups from different areas and countries, if this trial goes well, the drug will likely be approved. Phase 4 happens after a drug has been approved for further testing in a larger group over a longer period of time.

  CO is short for corona, the disease group that caused the pandemic, VI is short for virus, D for disease and 2019 indicates the year it began.
  <br>
  A lot of time was spent deciding the name for this pandemic at it was particularly important that the widespread name for the disease was not discriminatory or offensive to any group or people. Other names that refer to COVID-19 may be offensive or even racist, so it is good to refer to the disease that caused the pandemic as COVID-19.

  Not all masks are the same and hence cannot offer the same amount of protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  A face shield does not provide the same kind of protection as a face mask and should not act as replacement, unless a face mask cannot be worn. There are many different types of face masks but a face mask with 3 layers is recommended.
