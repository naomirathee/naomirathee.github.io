  Future proof your health using Foresight
  </div>
<div class=lefttitle>
  Are you concerned about the negative health impacts of prolonged screen use?
  </div>
  <div class="leftbody">
    As a direct result of COVID-19, many of us are spending an excess amount of time spent looking at a screen. Multiple studies have shown that increased screen time can negatively impact physical wellbeing, increasing eye strain, unhealthy eating habits and as a direct result of COVID-19, increased screen time has been found to be associated with the onset and progression of myopia (nearsighted).

   Foresight keeps an eye on you, so you don’t have to 
  </div>
  <div class="rightbody">
    Using Deep Fusion camera technology and machine learning, Foresight is able to detect myriad of health concerns early, such as eye damage, mental health, Parkinson’s disease etc. Combining artificial intelligence and a database of previously diagnosed and leading up to diagnosis images, Foresight will notify you when it recognises similarities to previously diagnosed individuals.

    Foresight is offered as a browser extension or as an app, so you can use it all times no matter what device you’re on.

    Your health data will be compared to thousands of accumulated health data which keeps an eye out for you in case our machine learning technology notices a pattern emerging. This includes anything from telling you to get up and walk around for a few minutes to prevent eye fatigue or if signs of depression emerge.
