   The concept for the Vitamin D Deficiency visual journal was to bring awareness to the global health crisis of insufficient or deficient blood levels of vitamin d. It is a common misconception that the general public living in developed nations have adequate vitamin D blood levels. The goal of this journal is to provide an accessible documentation of vitamin D deficiency through imagery to increase awareness, ultimately resulting in less associated complications. 
   <br>
   <br>
   The purpose of this journal was not to be overly academic to allow for accessibility to the general public. Whilst several peer-reviewed articles are documented in “literature”, their purpose is to be used as supplementary reading and referencing to information provided throughout visual documentation, not the primary source of information. The grid layout follows similar layouts used in academic journals so as to look reminiscent to those familiar with such articles. This also allows for the reader to get a general understanding of the content in each topic without examining each image. 
   <br> 
   <br>
   The initial homepage was designed to be minimalistic and without imagery so that the reader would see the clear message of “vitamin D deficiency” and would be compelled to learn more. Once entered into the website, the initial elements from the original page remain, but are presented in a way that doesn’t diminish legibility but maintains aesthetic appearance. The use of rainbow animation reminds the reader of what they most likely already know – that vitamin D can be sourced from the sun – and moreover the neon purple to consolidate this correlation with ultra-violet radiation. The use of black and white imagery (when not hovering over) is to allow for ease of use. It is extremely jarring to browse through colourful images that do not harmonise with each other. The flow of the website follows what a reader would expect to see from a website providing medical information which usually starts with a general discussion, causes, symptoms and treatment. As this website aims to provide comprehensive information, extra categories were included in the navigation
   <br>
   <br>
   When the reader has reached the bottom of the page, there is a clear option in the footer for the reader to proceed to the next page or to revisit the previous page with ease. Each image was chosen to be approachable and familiar, with the exception of a few scientific images, however all images were provided with a brief description so that there is no room for interpretation. The succession of images are prioritised descending from most compelling and important information to less important takeaways, as well as considering ease of flow.
