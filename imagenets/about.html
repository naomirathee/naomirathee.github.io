   Vitamin D deficiency is a global health issue. Despite over a billion people worldwide who are vitamin D deficient or insufficient, no international health organisations or government bodies have declared a health emergency and thus allowing the deficiency to thrive. Furthermore, the deficiency often goes unnoticed even for those who regularly visit their doctors, due to a systemic issue in the way majority of the developed world deems sufficient vitamin D blood levels. 
   <br>
   <br>
   This journal explores vitamin d deficiency through the medium of visual narrative. Studies have shown that using visual explanations improves learning, particularly for science topics that are notoriously difficult to learn. The nature of the way scientific topics is discussed means that generally only through verbal or written communication can scientific understanding can be taught and determined. This creates a divide between those who are scientifically literate and can comprehend scientific jargon; and everyone else. It is imperative that knowledge repositories exist via an accessible vehicle for the masses.
   <br> 
   <br>
   This journal aims to change the way we systemically learn and understand scientific topics for those without cognate credentials with the objective of improving average scientific literacy and awareness. Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide problem with serious potential health consequences and is frequently overlooked despite exhaustive studies spanning well over 50 years. Vitamin D Deficiency journal converges knowledge from multiple peer reviewed articles presented through picture. This journal hopes its readers will learn from high quality studies and make individual changes towards a healthier population.
