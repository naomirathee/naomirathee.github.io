  The nature of pandemics is oddly beautiful in that they strip us of all social constructs and we are each left with equal responsibility for the community. Diseases are blind to race, financial status, creed and other social constructs societies have put stock into. Public health response must be at equilibrium with the impartiality of disease. It is the human response that allows for disparities in public health outcomes and it is the individualsâ€™ due diligence to ensure that those disparities are minimised for the health of the wider community. Time and time again, humans have succumbed to 
  diseases at the hands of good intention meddled with bias.

  This was put into focus in 2014 during the West African Ebola outbreak which spiralled out of control. Following the epidemic control protocol, foreign professionals swooped in with little cognisance of local customs and were confronted with resistance from locals (Scott 2016). There was little trust in government or authority, particularly foreign government due to their history of colonisation. At this time, treatment was stunted due to understaffed and underfunded healthcare services, as well as very little treatment options. Hospitals had little choice but put infected patients in quarantine to break the cycle of transmission. Families would try and visit, resulting in high nosocomial infection. Due to high viraemia at the time of death, the World Health Organisation required that all infected corpses be cremated despite the crematory procedure being against the cultural practice of locals (et al.). 
  Many families distrusted hospitals and kept their infected loved ones at home and maintained local burial practices where at least 20% of infections came from (World Health Organisation 2014). There were many causes of infection during the epidemic, but Western countries arriving with insensitivity to cultural practice definitely could have been avoided.

  A similar lack of cognisance was observed when non-government organisations funded the construction of toilets in Timor-Leste, leaving the country strewn with toilet graveyards due to locals unwilling to adopt the foreign concept with poor sanitation persisting (Francis 2017). Public health professionals did not collaborate with locals to investigate why the issue was occurring and consequently wasted resources. This is a result of Western solutions being pressed on non-Western communities and sadly worsening circumstances.

  As long as governments exist, public health response must operate within systems of political agendas and bias. 
  During COVID-19 the Victorian state government followed the advice of various public health professionals. What was remiss, however, was the exclusionary public health measures that only considered Victorians who understood English. 
  As with the language-blindness of disease, only providing accessible information to those who speak English in such a 
  multicultural state as Victoria; such tactics could indeed prove to be detrimental to public health outcomes.
